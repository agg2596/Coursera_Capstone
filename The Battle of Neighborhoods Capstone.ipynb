Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.\n\nProspective new store owners need to take into account many different factors when deciding where to open their business, even moreso for a business such as a restaurant. Knowing the location and neighborhood density of different genres of food would help owners know better neighborhoods to target, since opening the 2nd Italian restaurant in a neighborhood likely has better staying potential and earning potential than the 8th Italian restaurant in a separate part of Boston."
